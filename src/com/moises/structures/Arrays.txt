	- Contiguous block in memory
	- Can´t be resized
	- Every element occupies the same amount of space of memory
	- If we know the index of the element, the time to retrieve the element will be the same.
	- Calculate memory address  = x+i*y
	(x = start, i = element, y= size of each element)
	- Fast to retrieve elements when we have the index O(1)
	-Retrieve element when we dont have the index O(n)
